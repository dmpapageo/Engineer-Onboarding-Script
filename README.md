# Developer Onboarding Script for macOS

## Overview
This script is designed to streamline the onboarding process for developers on macOS systems. It automates the installation of essential tools and applications like Homebrew, Slack, Visual Studio Code, Google Chrome, Docker, GPG Keychain, and MongoDB.

## Prerequisites
- A macOS system with administrator access.
- Command Line Tools for Xcode (These are usually installed automatically during the Homebrew installation, but if not, you can install them manually by running `xcode-select --install` in the terminal).

   - Download `onboarding_script.sh` from this repository.

2. **Running the Script**
   - Open the Terminal.
   - Navigate to the directory where `onboarding_script.sh` is located. For example, if it's in your Downloads folder, type `cd Downloads`.
   - Make the script executable by running: 
     ```
     chmod +x onboarding_script.sh
     ```
   - Execute the script by typing:
     ```
     ./onboarding_script.sh
     ```

## What the Script Does
- Installs Homebrew, a package manager for macOS.
- Updates Homebrew to the latest version and upgrades any existing packages.
- Installs the following applications:
  - Slack: a collaboration and communication tool.
  - Visual Studio Code: a powerful code editor.
  - Google Chrome: a web browser.
  - Docker: a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications.
  - GPG Suite: a tool for secure encryption and signing of data.
